## 🦞🦞🦞🏅 Setting up Agentic AI with Openclaw

*A new open source project with OpenClawd is getting a lot of attention. For the first time you can let Agents do actual work. Tool is still in eairly stage, not mature and with a lot of security issues if you are not careful.
I will install and configure and have various use cases running to learn and experience with hands on.*
