# 📈 Weekly Note — Model Portfolio
**Week of:** 2026-02-09 (Mon) → 2026-02-13 (Fri)  
**Author:** Holger

## 🧭 Portfolio context
- Starting an **8-stock growth-tilted basket** (max **50% US**) with a strict **20-transaction lifetime** budget.
- Goal: **compound intelligently** — no lottery tickets 🎰❌.
- Default action is **HOLD**. Trades only if we have a **clear thesis change**, **risk event**, or a **materially better swap**.

## ⏪ Looking 1 week back (what mattered)
_(I’ll fill this properly on Monday after we’ve seen how markets closed Fri 2026-02-06.)_

## ⏩ Looking 1 week forward (what I’m watching)
### 1) 🏦 Rates & macro tone
- Any sharp shift in **rate expectations** can reprice long-duration growth quickly.

### 2) 🤖 AI & semis sentiment
- Watch for crowded positioning and headline-driven volatility around **AI capex** narratives.

### 3) 🔎 Company-specific checkpoints
- **MSFT / GOOGL / AMZN:** AI product traction + cloud demand commentary.
- **NVDA:** demand signals + broader AI hardware appetite.
- **ASML / ASM:** order trends and semi-cycle signals (ignore the noise, watch bookings).
- **SAP:** enterprise spend mood + cloud transition momentum.
- **NOVO:** GLP-1 demand, competition, and any pricing/regulatory headlines.

## ✅ Potential actions (pre-commitment)
- **None planned.** We start with the 8 initial buys (8 trades). Every additional trade must **earn its slot** 🧮.

## ❓ Questions for Tom
- Any names you strongly want to **include/exclude** before Monday’s buy list is locked?
- Do you want a **max position cap** inside the model (e.g., 20–25%) as a hard rule?

## ⏪ Looking 1 week back (what mattered)
- **This is week 1** of the model portfolio, so there’s no performance week to review yet.
- Admin done today:
  - Portfolio sheet exists (“Model Portfolio - Start 2026-02-09”)
  - **Initial allocation logged** as 8 BUY transactions (DKK 400,000 total).
  - **Entry price / shares** are left blank for now (we can fill once we decide the pricing convention: market open vs close, or Tom’s actual fills).

## 🧾 Initial basket (start weights)
- MSFT 13.75%
- NVDA 13.75%
- AMZN 11.25%
- GOOGL 11.25%
- ASML.AS 15.00%
- NOVO-B.CO 11.25%
- SAP.DE 12.50%
- ASM.AS 11.25%

## ✅ Potential actions (pre-commitment)
- **None planned.** We start with the 8 initial buys (8 trades). Every additional trade must **earn its slot** 🧮.

## 🧾 Pricing convention (locked)
- **Weekly reference price:** *previous trading day close* (i.e., Friday close when we do the Monday check-in).
- **FX convention:** use the same day’s close for FX when converting to DKK for simulated share counts.
- Rationale: it’s the cleanest and most comparable way to “start the week”.

## ✅ Potential actions (pre-commitment)
- **None planned.** We start with the 8 initial buys (8 trades). Every additional trade must **earn its slot** 🧮.

## ❓ Open question (optional)
- If you ever want to switch from “model-only” to realism: we can move to **your actual fills**, but it’s extra manual work.
