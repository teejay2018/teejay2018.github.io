# 🌍 Setting up own landscape for technology - links and locations

*The landscape is growing with more and more components and here is a collection of links involved.
Core structure is a minimum linux VM hosted at Hetzner, with Ubuntu installed.
All software is open source and webfacing components are managed using nginx proxy.
Domains involved is cantaloop.dk and orchestrator.dk with multiple subdomains.
Besides the server this blog is part of landscape - build on Jekyll static MD pages and hosted on GitHub pages.
Lastly also LMStudio on my MacBook Air is part of landscape, for now only used along with Ollama for hosting open source foundation models*
