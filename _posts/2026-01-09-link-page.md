# 🚀 Setting up own landscape for technology - links and locations

*The landscape is growing with more and more components and here is a collection of links involved.<br>
Core structure is a minimum linux VM hosted at Hetzner, with Ubuntu installed.<br>
All software is open source and webfacing components are managed using nginx proxy.<br>
Domains involved is cantaloop.dk and orchestrator.dk with multiple subdomains.<br>
Besides the server this blog is part of landscape - build on Jekyll static MD pages and hosted on GitHub pages.<br>
Lastly also LMStudio on my MacBook Air is part of landscape, for now only used along with Ollama for hosting open source foundation models*
